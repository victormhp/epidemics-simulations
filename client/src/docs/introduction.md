## Epidemics Simulations

Epidemics Simulations is a web application that allows you to create and visualize epidemics on networks. The application is built using SvelteKit as a Static Site Generator (SSG) for the frontend and Flask as the backend web server.

Whether you're a researcher, educator, or passionate enthusiast in the field of epidemiology, this application provides a user-friendly platform to conduct simulations, analyze results, and gain valuable insights.

## EoN Module

The simulations are made possible by [EoN](https://github.com/springer-math/Mathematics-of-Epidemics-on-Networks), a Python package designed for simulating epidemics on networks and solving Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) models of disease spread.

For more details on using the EoN module, refer to the [Epidemics on Networks Documentation](https://epidemicsonnetworks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/EoN.html). It provides comprehensive information on utilizing the EoN package.
